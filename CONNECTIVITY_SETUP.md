# Internet Connectivity Checking Setup

This document explains how the internet connectivity checking system works in your Flutter app.

## Overview

The app now includes a robust internet connectivity checking system that:

1. Shows a native splash screen using `flutter_native_splash`
2. Transitions to a connectivity checking screen
3. Automatically checks internet connectivity
4. Navigates to the main app if connected
5. Shows a retry dialog if not connected

## How It Works

### 1. Native Splash Screen
- Uses `flutter_native_splash` to show a native splash screen during app initialization
- Displays your app logo on a consistent background
- Provides a smooth, native experience

### 2. Connectivity Screen
- Shows immediately after the native splash screen
- Checks internet connectivity using `connectivity_plus`
- Provides smooth animations and transitions
- Matches your app's visual theme

### 3. Connectivity Service
- Singleton service for managing connectivity checks
- Provides real-time connectivity status updates
- Handles connectivity changes automatically

## Files Structure

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── connectivity_service.dart    # Connectivity management
│   └── widgets/
│       └── main_navigation.dart         # Main app navigation
├── features/
│   └── connectivity/
│       └── connectivity_screen.dart     # Connectivity checking UI
└── main.dart                           # App entry point
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
The following dependencies are already added to your `pubspec.yaml`:
- `connectivity_plus: ^5.0.2`
- `flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.10` (dev dependency)

### 2. Configure Native Splash Screen
Run the following command to generate the native splash screen:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

### 3. Customize the Configuration
Edit `flutter_native_splash.yaml` to customize:
- Background color
- Logo image
- Image size
- Platform-specific settings

### 4. Rebuild the App
After making changes to the splash screen configuration:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

## Features

### ✅ Automatic Connectivity Checking
- Checks connectivity as soon as the app starts
- Real-time connectivity monitoring
- Automatic retry functionality

### ✅ Smooth User Experience
- Consistent visual design with your app theme
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Native splash screen integration

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful handling of connectivity errors
- User-friendly error messages in Arabic
- Retry and exit options

### ✅ Maintainable Code
- Clean separation of concerns
- Singleton service pattern
- Reusable components

## Customization

### Changing the Theme
Edit the colors in `connectivity_screen.dart`:
```dart
backgroundColor: const Color(0xFFFFF8E1), // Background color
valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(
  Color(0xFFFFC107), // Progress indicator color
),
```

### Modifying Messages
Update the Arabic text in `connectivity_screen.dart`:
```dart
'جاري التحقق من الاتصال...' // "Checking connection..."
'يرجى التحقق من اتصال الإنترنت' // "Please check your internet connection"
```

### Adding More Connectivity Logic
Extend `ConnectivityService` to add more functionality:
```dart
// Add to connectivity_service.dart
Future<bool> checkSpecificEndpoint() async {
  // Custom connectivity logic
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Native Splash Screen Not Showing
1. Ensure you've run `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create`
2. Clean and rebuild the app: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Check that the image path in `flutter_native_splash.yaml` is correct

### Connectivity Not Detected
1. Verify that `connectivity_plus` is properly added to dependencies
2. Check Android permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### App Stuck on Loading Screen
1. Check that the `ConnectivityScreen` is properly set as the home screen in `main.dart`
2. Verify that all imports are correct
3. Check for any console errors

## Best Practices

1. **Test on Real Devices**: Always test connectivity features on real devices, not just simulators
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider scenarios like airplane mode, VPN connections, etc.
3. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback about what's happening during connectivity checks
4. **Performance**: Keep connectivity checks quick to avoid long loading times
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure error messages are accessible and clear

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding these features in the future:
- Offline mode with cached data
- Different connectivity check strategies (ping, DNS lookup, etc.)
- Connectivity quality indicators
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Network type detection (WiFi vs Mobile)
